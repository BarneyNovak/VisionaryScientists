            <h4>Welcome to the third edition of the John von Neumann Series of Pure and Applied Sciences!</h4>
            <p>We are pleased to announce that the third edition of the Neumann Series will take place on October 11 at the Liberty Science Center. The title of the conference is Visionaries of the Future: Celebrating Mathematics, Science and the Art of Strategic Play.</p>
            <p>1. First, the conference aims to connect the areas in which John von Neumann had a lasting impact with the art of play. We believe that games are an important tool for engaging the youngest generation in science.
            </p>
            <p>2. Science and play are linked, and creative games play an important role in educating children and introducing them to the wonderful world of science. Most of the games used in the classroom have a mathematical basis, a scientific field in which von Neumann was undoubtedly a genius.
            </p>
            <p>3. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize to the Hungarian-born American economist John Charles Harsanyi, who received it together with two other great game theorists, John F. Nash and Reinhard Selten. The founder of modern game theory was John von Neumann together with his colleague Oscar Morgenstein. Game theory is a fascinating field that has also appeared in popular culture, such as in The Beautiful Mind about John F. Nash, played by Academic Award winner Russel Crowe. But did you know that John C. Harsanyi himself appears in the movie?
            </p>
            <p>4. The year 1994, when Harsanyi received his Nobel Prize, was a very special year because another Hungarian-born American scientist, George Andrew Olah, also received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It will come as no surprise to you that John von Neumann earned his first degree in chemical engineering at ETH Zurich before earning his doctorate in mathematics.</p>
            <p>5. We believe that chess is probably the best game that can inspire children to think logically and develop mathematical skills. For this reason, we are pleased to announce a panel discussion between Judit Polgar, the best female chess player of all time, and Paul Hoffman, the author of the book King's Gambit.</p>
            <p>6. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Rubik's Cube, the most popular puzzle and “toy” in human history, which is a great case study in combinatorial mathematics and problem solving.</p>
            <p>The venue, Liberty Science Center, is the best place to celebrate these scientists and achieve our goals as it aims to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and engage learners of all ages in the power, promise and fun of science and technology. More than 750,000 students, teachers and parents visit Liberty Science Center each year, and tens of thousands more participate in the center's off-site and online programs. During the event, in addition to the scientific conference, interactive games will be presented outside the conference room, where visitors to the LSC can take a look at chess, Rubik's Cube and other innovative games.</p>
            <p>We believe the event will help celebrate science and inspire younger and older people to immerse themselves in the wonderful world of science and play. And in this way, visionary scientists, great inventions and educational tools can together contribute to the popularization of STEM education and showcase old and new tools that can help achieve these goals.</p>

            <h2>Visionaries of the Future: Celebrating Mathematics, Science and the Art of Strategic Play</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Welcome to the third edition of the John von Neumann Series of Pure and Applied Sciences</p>
            <p>I am pleased to announce that the third edition of the John von Neumann Series of Pure and Applied Sciences will take place in fall 2024. The title of the conference is "Visionaries of the Future": Celebrating Mathematics, Science and the Art of Strategic Play. This event will celebrate the profound impact of visionary scientists whose groundbreaking ideas have shaped the fields of mathematics, artificial intelligence, game theory and beyond.</p>
            <p>Each event has a different focus, and now it's about connecting the areas where John von Neumann has had a lasting impact with the art of play. We believe that games are an important tool to get the youngest generation interested in science. In this way, science and play are linked, and creative games play an important role in educating children and introducing them to the wonderful world of science. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize to John Charles Harsanyi, who received it together with two other great game theorists, John F. Nash and Reinhard Selten. Game theory is interesting not least because of the movie The Beautiful Mind about John F. Nash with Russel Crow. Not many people know that John C. Harsanyi appears in the movie himself!</p>
            <p>The venue, Liberty Science Center, is the best place to achieve these goals as it aims to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and engage learners of all ages in the power, promise and fun of science and technology. More than 750,000 students, teachers and parents visit Liberty Science Center each year, and tens of thousands more participate in the center's off-site and online programs.</p>
            <p>During the event, in addition to the scientific conference, interactive games are presented outside the conference room, where LSC visitors can take a look at chess, the Rubik's Cube and other innovative games. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the cube, the most popular puzzle game and “toy” in human history, which is a great case study of combinatorial mathematics and problem solving. Various side events will take place throughout the day to celebrate the uniqueness of the cube..</p>
            <p>And last but not least, we think that chess is also one of the games that can inspire children to think logically and explore scientifically. For this reason, we are pleased to announce a panel discussion between Judit Polgar, the best female chess player of all time, and Paul Hoffman, the author of the book “King`s Gambit”</p>
            <p>We believe the event will help celebrate the sciences and inspire younger and older people to immerse themselves in the wonderful world of science and play.</p>
